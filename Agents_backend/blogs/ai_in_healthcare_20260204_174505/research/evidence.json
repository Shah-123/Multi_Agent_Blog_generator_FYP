    "snippet": "OpenAI launched ChatGPT health to encourage users to upload medical histories, records and data. Anthropic did the same with Claude a few days later. Google has reportedly removed some AI Overviews for health-related questions following an investigation that found some information misleading. Elon Musk said Grok could give medical diagnoses from X-rays or MRI images, which is considered dangerous. Digital twins (AI-powered, real-time virtual replicas of individual patients) have emerged as transformative innovations in personalized medicine, though practical results may vary. AI is increasingly integrated into the patient journey, assisting from symptom checking at home to triage and recovery, acting as invisible digital helpers that translate reports, flag drug interactions, analyze scans, and detect subtle changes in patient data.",
