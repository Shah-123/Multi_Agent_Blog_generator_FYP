- Direct incitement to violence or terrorism (e.g., "how to build a bomb", "why we should attack X")
- Explicit sexual/pornographic content
- Instructions for illegal activities (drug manufacturing, hacking tutorials, fraud)
- Targeted hate speech against specific ethnic/religious groups (e.g., "why X race is inferior")
- Pure gibberish with no discernible meaning

Discussing controversial policies, military strategy, or geopolitical consequences is legitimate journalism.
